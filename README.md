## Summary

The goal of this test is to make you code a small ReactJS app. We have prepared a skeleton app for you, but please change whatever you want (CSS files, HTML structure, JS structure, etc).

The app will have two different components:
- **Activity Feed** - simple list of calls
- **Activity Detail** - detail of a call
- **Archive** - the final user should be able to archive (and unarchive) a call. Archived calls will no longer be displayed on the Activity Feed and should have a separate Archived Tab.

Show us what you can do in 24 hours. You will be assessed on the following parameters: 
- Focus on design (Pay attention to the UI/UX and transitions)
- Best React Practices
- Code Readability and Maintainability

## Submission
After you're done with the assignment, please submit a link to the **GitHub/Bitbucket repository** (make sure it's public) with your code **AND** a deployment link where our recruiters can interact with the live version. You can use freely available tools like **Netlify, Vercel, Heroku, etc** to deploy your React application.

**Note:** Submissions without a valid repository and deployment link will be removed from any further consideration.

To give you an idea, here's what our app looks like:

## Installation

We're using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) here (but you can use npm):

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

## API documentation

### Routes

Here is the API address: https://aircall-job.herokuapp.com.

As you can see, it's hosted on a free Heroku server, which means that the first time you will fetch the API, it will take few seconds to answer.

- **GET** - https://aircall-job.herokuapp.com/activities: get calls to display in the Activity Feed
- **GET** - https://aircall-job.herokuapp.com/activities/:id: retrieve a specific call details
- **POST** - https://aircall-job.herokuapp.com/activities/:id: update a call. The only field updatable is `is_archived (bool)`. You'll need to send a JSON in the request body:
```
{
  is_archived: true
}
```
- **GET** - https://aircall-job.herokuapp.com/reset: Reset all calls to initial state (usefull if you archived all calls).

### Call object

- **id** - unique ID of call
- **created_at** - creation date
- **direction** - `inbound` or `outbound` call
- **from** - caller's number
- **to** - callee's number
- **via** - Aircall number used for the call
